# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C#. It is a console application where two players can take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to achieve three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
- Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
- Build and run the project.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.


This project serves as a basic example of object-oriented programming in C# and demonstrates concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. It can be used as a starting point for more complex game implementations.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the game as you see fit!

Enjoy playing!
